/**	The Mesh class that holds a 3D mesh and possibly an animated skeleton.
 *	@remarks
 *		This class controls a Mesh as defined by the 3d importing library.
 *		It handles holding a list of vertices, bones, faces, etc. It also
 *		holds a list of animations and things involving that. Keep in mind
 *		that this class isn't used directly for MeshRendering for Entities.
 *		The MeshRenderer class is used for that, and MeshRenderer has functions
 *		to manage changing the model and animset of the Mesh, and for attaching
 *		children mesh to it (possible, not sure yet)
 *	@todo
 *		Be sure this works fully in conjuction with the importers Mesh classes.
 *		Have this display as-is (ONLY for debug purposes; Later, require an Entity with MeshRenderer and SceneNode)
